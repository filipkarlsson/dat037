Time complexity for contains() in BinSearchIntSet is: 5*log2(n)+6 = O(log(n))

It can be seen below that the binary search used in both BinarySearchIntSet and BinSearchGenSetAsIntSet give execution
times that is similar to log2(the nuber of operations).

The complexity of the method "contains()" was calculated in the comments as follows:

    public boolean contains(int element){
        return binarySearch(element,set) != -1;      // 1 + 1 for return and comparison
    }


    private int binarySearch(int element, int[] array){
        int middle = nrOfElements/2;            // + 1
        int max = nrOfElements;                 // + 1
        int min = 0;                            // + 1

        // Find out in witch half of "array" "element" is, or would be in.
                                                    // loop start
        while( min != max ){                        // + 1
            if (element == array[middle]) {         // + 1
                return middle;
            } else if (element > array[middle]) {   // + 1
                min = middle + 1;
            } else {
                max = middle;                       // + 1
            }
            middle = (min+max)/2;                   // + 1
        }                                           // loop end
        return -1;                  // + 1
    }

As the loop part of the method binary search divides the search-area by half in each loop, the total number of loops
will be at most log2(n) where n is the size of the original search-area. As there are 5 operations in the loop and 6
operations outside of the loop, the total number of operations, and also a measure of how long time it will take to run
the method assuming that all operations take the same ammount of time, sums up to 5*log2(n)+6.
